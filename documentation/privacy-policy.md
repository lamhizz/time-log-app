**Privacy Policy for Wurk Wurk**

**Last Updated: October 31, 2025**

Your privacy is the most important feature of Wurk Wurk. Our app is designed from the ground up to be a private, personal tool. You are the only person who can see your data.

This policy explains what information is handled and, more importantly, what information we **never** see or collect.

**1\. Our Core Privacy Promise: We Don't See Your Data**

Wurk Wurk is a "zero-knowledge" application. We **do not** collect, store, sell, share, or analyze your personal log data.

1.  We **DO NOT** see what you write in your logs.
2.  We **DO NOT** see your tags, task timers, or notes.
3.  We **DO NOT** have access to your Google Sheet.
4.  We **DO NOT** have servers that store your personal data.

**2\. How Your Data is Handled**

Your data's journey is simple and stays entirely within your own Google Account.

1.  **You type** your log into the Wurk Wurk Chrome extension on your browser.
2.  The extension **securely sends** this data to a Google Apps Script that runs **inside your own Google Account.**
3.  That script **writes the data** directly into the **private Google Sheet that you own** and control, which is stored in your private Google Drive.

At no point in this process does your personal log data ever pass through a server owned or operated by Wurk Wurk.

**3\. What Information We *Do* Handle**

**A. Your Work Logs (Handled by You):** This is the text, tags, and timestamps you create. As stated above, this data is yours, and we never see it. You are the "data controller" for this information. You can delete, modify, or share your data at any time by directly editing your Google Sheet.

**B. Your Extension Settings (Stored Locally):** Your settings—such as your prompt interval, "Do Not Disturb" list, and quick tags—are saved using your browser's local storage. This data is stored *on your computer* and is not transmitted to us.

**C. Anonymous Usage Statistics (Handled by Google):** The Google Chrome Web Store may automatically collect and provide us with anonymized, aggregate data, such as how many users have installed or uninstalled the extension. This data is anonymous, cannot be used to identify you, and is not connected to your personal logs in any way.

**4\. Your Relationship with Google**

Because your data is stored in your Google Sheet, your data is subject to **Google's Privacy Policy** and **Terms of Service.** We rely on Google's security infrastructure to protect the data within your account.

**5\. Changes to This Policy**

We may update this policy in the future. If we make significant changes, we will notify users through the extension's options page or the Chrome Web Store.
