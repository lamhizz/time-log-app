⚙️ **App Workflow: Setup to Insight**

1.  **Setup (Trust & Ownership):** You connect the extension to your **private Google Sheet**. This establishes a secure, personalized data pipeline that you own.
2.  **Logging (Low-Friction Input):** The extension automatically and gently prompts you at set intervals to log your current activity. This minimizes effort and maintains an **accurate, consistent record** of your entire workday.
3.  **Analysis (Data Collection):** Logs, tags, and task durations are instantly sent to your Google Sheet, quietly creating a **rich, objective dataset** of your time spent.
4.  **Insight (Reflection & Improvement):** You review your own data to **spot patterns, identify time sinks (blindsides), and understand *how* you work**. This clarity allows you to learn, adjust your habits, and manage your time more effectively.

🎯 **General Principle of App Purpose**  

The app's purpose is to act as an **Automated, Objective Mirror** for your work schedule, enabling **Mindful Productivity**. It replaces subjective guessing with clean, consistent data to help you **spend your time wisely and intentionally improve** your performance day over day.
