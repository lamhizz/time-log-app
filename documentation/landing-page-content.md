**Stop Guessing. Start Seeing.**

**Wurk Wurk is a mindful work logger that helps you understand where your time *really* goes.**

It's not another complex tracker. It's a simple Chrome extension that sends your activity logs to a **100% private Google Sheet that you own.** Spot hidden patterns, eliminate blindsides, and finally build a more focused, productive workday.

**(Problem Section)**

**Does This Sound Familiar?**

You end the day feeling exhausted, but your most important work is still untouched. You *feel* busy, but you don't feel *productive*.

1.  You're **stuck in "reactive mode,"** answering emails and chats all day.
2.  Your most **important projects** keep getting pushed to "tomorrow."
3.  You're **constantly interrupted,** and "deep work" feels impossible.
4.  Your 30-minute task **somehow expanded** to fill the entire afternoon.
5.  You look at the clock at 5 PM and think, **"Where did my day go?"**

**(Solution Section)**

**Replace Guesswork with Your Own Data.**

You can't fix what you can't see. Wurk Wurk is the **automated, objective mirror** for your workday.

It's not another to-do list. It's a "to-done" list.

By gently prompting you to log what you *just did*, it creates an honest, powerful dataset. The power isn't in the *tracking*; it's in the **15-minute weekly review** that helps you learn, adjust, and improve.

**(How It Works Section)**

**Your Effortless Path from Logging to Learning**

**1\. Setup (1 Minute)** Connect the extension to your **private Google Sheet.** Your data is 100% yours, 100% secure.

**2\. Log (5 Seconds)** At your chosen interval (e.g., every 20 mins), a simple prompt asks, "What are you working on?" Use tags, quick actions, or the built-in timer.

**3\. Review (15 Minutes / Week)** Open your Google Sheet. See your whole week. Filter by tags like "Meeting" or "Focus." This is where the "Aha!" moments happen.

**4\. Improve (Daily)** See a pattern? Make a small change. Block focus time. Decline a meeting. Your log gives you the data you need to take back control.

**(Feature Highlights Section)**

**All the Features You Need. None You Don't.**

1.  **You Own Your Data** Your logs are sent *instantly and securely* to a Google Sheet you control. We never see, store, or sell your data. Period.
2.  **Log in Seconds** Use custom tags ("Email," "Dev"), one-click quick actions ("Doing Same," "Break"), or the built-in task timer to log without breaking your flow.
3.  **Protect Your Focus** Set your working hours and use "Do Not Disturb" mode to automatically disable prompts on specific sites (like meet.google.com or youtube.com).
4.  **You're in Control** In the zone? A single click to **Snooze** or **Skip** a prompt. No stress, no judgment. It works for you, not the other way around.

**(Use Case / Blindsides Section)**

**Find the Blindsides You Didn't Know You Had**

Your log will show you the truth.

1.  **Find the "Urgent vs. Important" Trap** Discover just how much time is lost to "Admin" and "Chat" vs. the "Deep Work" that actually moves your career forward.
2.  **See the True Cost of Interruptions** Identify a "fractured" workday. See how 10 small interruptions turned your 1-hour task into a 3-hour marathon.
3.  **Expose "Work Creep"** Get a clear picture of how often work is bleeding into your personal time. Your log will show all the "quick checks" at 8 PM.
4.  **Spot Your Energy Mismatch** Are you wasting your peak morning focus on low-value meetings? Your log will give you the evidence you need to reschedule your week.

**(Testimonials / Social Proof Section)**

**"I was shocked. I thought I was good at managing my time. My first-week log showed I was spending over 2 hours a day on 'quick email checks.' This app has been a game-changer for my focus."** — Alex M., Senior Developer

**"I love that it just sends to my *own* Google Sheet. It's my data. No creepy tracking, no complex reports I don't need. It's simple, private, and powerful."** — Sarah K., Project Manager

**"The 'Doing Same' button is genius. It's so easy to use. By reviewing my log, I realized my afternoons were a mess. I've since blocked 2-3 PM for focus time, and my productivity has doubled."** — David R., Marketing Lead

**(Privacy & Promise Section)**

**Your Log is Yours. Period.**

We believe that self-reflection requires total privacy.

Wurk Wurk is a "data-less" app. We **never** see, store, or analyze your logs. The extension sends your input *directly* from your browser to your Google Sheet via Google's own secure Apps Script. You are the only one with access.

**Our Promise:** We give you the simplest tool to capture the truth. You get the clarity you need to improve.

**(Final Call to Action - CTA)**

It takes 2 minutes to set up. Get the clarity you've been missing and start building a smarter workday.
