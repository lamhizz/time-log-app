**The Wurk Wurk Method: From Logging to Learning**

Welcome to Wurk Wurk! You've just installed a powerful tool. But the tool itself doesn't create value—your *method* does.

The app's job is to make logging effortless. Your job is to make reflection consistent.

This simple 4-step loop is the key to turning your raw data into career-changing insights.

**Step 1: Capture with Honesty, Not Perfection**

The foundation of all insight is an honest, consistent log.

1.  **Embrace the Prompt:** When the popup appears, log what you *actually* just did. Don't try to make your log look "productive." If you were distracted by the news for 15 minutes, log "Admin" or "Browsing." Real insight requires real data.
2.  **Use the Shortcuts:** "Doing Same" and "Break" are your best friends. They ensure your log stays complete with zero effort, which is essential for spotting focus blocks or rest patterns.
3.  **It's a Log, Not a Plan:** This is a record of the past, not a to-do list for the future. Log what *happened*, not what you *hope* will happen.

**Step 2: Categorize for Clarity**

A log of text is a diary. A log of *tags* is a dataset.

1.  **Tags are Your Superpower:** Tags (Meeting, Focus Time, Email, Project X) are how you will find your patterns. Be disciplined and apply a tag to every single entry.
2.  **Be Consistent:** Decide on your main categories and stick to them. This makes it easy to filter your Google Sheet later and ask, "How many hours did I *really* spend in 'Meetings' this week?"

**Step 3: Review for Patterns (The 15-Minute Review)**

This is the most important step. Your log is worthless if you never read it.

1.  **Block 15 Minutes:** Schedule a recurring time every week (e.g., Friday at 3:00 PM) just to review your Google Sheet. Protect this time.
2.  **Ask "Why?":** Look at your data and be a detective.
3.  "Why did I spend 6 hours on 'Email'?"
4.  "What caused all the interruptions on Tuesday afternoon?" (That's a *blindside*.)
5.  "When was I in 'Focus Time'? What conditions made that possible?" (That's a *pattern to replicate*.)
6.  "Does this log reflect the work I *wanted* to do?"

**Step 4: Adjust with Small Experiments**

Turn your insights into action. This is how you improve.

1.  **Pick One Thing:** Based on your review, choose **one small, simple experiment** for next week.
2.  **Example:**
3.  *Insight:* "My log shows I'm interrupted by 'Admin' tasks every morning from 9-10 AM, which is my peak energy time."
4.  *Experiment:* "Next week, I will block 9-10 AM on my calendar as 'Focus Time' and use the 'Do Not Disturb' feature on my chat app."
5.  **Check Back:** At your next weekly review, check your log. Did the experiment work? If yes, keep the new habit. If no, try a new experiment.

That's it. **Capture -> Categorize -> Review -> Adjust.** This simple loop is the engine for mindful productivity.
